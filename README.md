# Pukari
Created onMeteor Distributed Hackathon 2015, October 10.

### [DEMO](http://pukari.meteor.com/)

### What is Pukari?
- Create and find an individual meetup to grab a coffee and chat.

### Why should I use?
Want to meet new people but big group or meetup is a little bit intimidating for some people. So, this is suitable for those.

Example 1, you have free time on lunch break, on way home, etc, you can use the time to meet a new person over a cup of coffee :)

Example 2, you want to find a partner to go to gym together :)
